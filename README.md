# Pan Cancer Pan Treatment Model Reproducibility
_This repository is a work in progress_

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and codes to reproduce the results and figures published in the paper "A pan-cancer, pan-treatment (PCPT) model for predicting drug responses from patient-derived xenografts with application to cancer types with sparse training data"

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks`: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that cover all the code related to data pre-processing, PCPT models, processing the results and generating the figures. 
- `data`: This folder contains some input data for running the code in the notebooks.
- `results`: This folder stores the output files generated by the notebooks.
- `figures`: This folder stores the output figures generated by the notebooks
